# MLND-P3
Choose KNN over GMM to apply on clustering the unknown pattern of retail channel customers.

Data Exploration: 
1. Decide which feature to predict and justify its relevance for identifying a specific customer.
2. Use scatter plot and correlation matrix to find pairs of features that exhibit some degree of correlation.

Data Preprocessing:
1. Outlier detection and decide whehter the data points be removed from the dataset.
2. Use PCA analysis to find the first four dimensions to find the level of variance in the data is explained. 
3. Silhouette coefficient were also applied to justify the number of clusters

Clustering:
1. The advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm as opposed to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm.
2. Use the Silhouette Coefficient score to justify the number of clusters. 
3. Observe the set of establishments each of the customer segments could best represent.

Conclusion:
1.  Justify which customer segments found above should perform an A/B Test for this change.
2.  Compare the custering algorithm and number of clusters chosen to the underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers and to Retailer customers.
3.  Use the clustering algorithm to predict and report if these classifications are as consistent with previous definition of the customer segments.
